**Air Quality and Pollutin and Forecast in India**

### Data Collection
This data is combined(across the years and states) and largely clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).

## EDA



## Analysis by type and pollution
- Sulfur dioxide, SO₂
- Nitrogen dioxide, NO₂


### Suspended Particulate Matter

### PIVOT tables

### Trends by regions

## Time Series Analysis

## ETS Decomposition (Error Trend Seasonality)
- Simple Moving Average
- Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) apply more weight to value more recent

## ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages

### Testing the Stationarity
Basically, we are trying to whether to accept the Null Hypothesis H0 (that the time series has a unit root, indicating it is non-stationary) or reject H0 and go with the Alternative Hypothesis (that the time series has no unit root and is stationary).

We end up deciding this based on the p-value return.

- A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.

- A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.
